Meeting with TA

People:
- Andrew Emmott (TA)
- Andrew Ekstedt
- Scott Russell

Status update:
* We are pretty close to meeting our requirements. The main thing left is implementing the final optimized variant of the DSSE algorithm (2-level pointer optimization).
* Poster deadline is Friday. We have a draft, but we were hoping to have updated benchmark data to include as a graphic.
    * We'll probably just have to print what we have
    * TA: you might be able to get an extension, but don't count on it
* We are also having some challenges finding a server with enough disk space to run tests on large databases.
    * TA: Attila may be able to give access to more university storage space 
    

Action items:
  * contact Attila and update him with our disk space woes
