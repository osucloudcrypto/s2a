- Scott Russell (remote)

Notes:
* TA: Do you consider yourselves on track or at least not more than a little behind?
* SR: We meet with Attila on Monday and went over his expectations for the term. His focus for the rest of the term is to have 2nd level pointer DSSE integrated with large database benchmarking. Andrew and Scott Merrill have continued working on the DSSE and I've started doing some Benchmarking tests. I think we can finish what he envisions for the term in time. 
* TA: sounds good
* TA: If this ends up being dramatically different than what is in your requirements document you will want to change it eventually 
* AE: Our short-term goal is to get some preliminary measurements, implement the two-level-pointer optimizations, and measure how they perform on a large database. 

* TA: I will have your progress reports graded before we meet next 
* AE: Okay. You received all the files you needed from us regarding the progress report and poster correctly? 
* TA: poster, yes. let me verify progress report since you are asking.
