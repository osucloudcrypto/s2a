\subsubsection{What technical information did you learn?}

Primarily, I learned about searchable encryption. I had never encountered the concept before this project, and now, having spent nine months working on it, I feel like I have a good knowledge of some of the ways it can be used, and some of its limitations. 

I also learned more about working in C++, which I didn't have much experience in prior to this capstone project. I'm still of the opinion that C++ is a poorly designed language - there is a lot of complexity and odd corner cases lurking to snare the uninitiated. I took some of the lessons learned about writing C++ and applied them to my class projects this term.

Don't depend on anyone.

I'm bad at project management.
