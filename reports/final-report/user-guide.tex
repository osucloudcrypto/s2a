\chapter{Project Documentation}

% How does your project work? (Could include the following...)
%   What is its structure?
%   What is its Theory of Operation?
%    Block and flow diagrams are good here.
%  How does one install your software, if any?
%  How does one run it?
%  Are there any special hardware, OS, or runtime requirements to run your software?
%  Any user guides, API documentation, etc.

This needs to be detailed enough to recreate and/or use your project!
